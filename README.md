# Overview

In this project, I aimed to enhance my understanding and proficiency in Erlang by developing a chat application. The software showcases the capabilities of Erlang in handling concurrent processes and maintaining reliability. The chat app allows multiple users to join, send messages, and interact in real-time, highlighting the strengths of Erlang's lightweight processes and message-passing mechanisms.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my knowledge of Erlang's syntax and functional programming paradigms. Through this project, I aimed to explore practical applications of Erlang
